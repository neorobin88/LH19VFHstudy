LO runs:

full-LO.yoda    = using the HJETS matrix elements integrated in HW7
VBF-LO.yoda     = using the VBF matrix elements integrated in HW7   
HV-LO.yoda      = generating LO events from the powheg box generators HW and HZ


NLO+PS:

full.yoda      = HW7 standalone, HJETS ME, dipole shower, MC@NLO matching
full-AO.yoda   = HW7 standalone, HJETS ME, AO shower, MC@NLO matching
VBF.yoda       = HW7 standalone, VBF ME, dipole shower, MC@NLO matching
VBF-AO.yoda    = HW7 standalone, VBF ME, AO shower, MC@NLO matching
VBF-PWG.yoda   = POWHEG BOX VBF + HW7 AO shower
HV-PWG.yoda    = POWHEG BOX HW&HZ + HW7 AO shower


HV runs are obtained modifying the HZ and the HW POWHEG BOX generators,
which implement only the leptonic decay of the boson.

-     at the event generation, electrons become down quarks, and
      neutrinos up quarks.

- HW: we generate 2 samples, one for HW+ -> H dbar u, one for HW- -> H d
      ubar. We add a factor 3, for SU(3), and a factor 2 to take into account
      all the hadronic W decays (we don't do flavour tagging).
      

- HZ: we generate 2 samples, one Z-> d dbar, one for Z-> u ubar.
      The Z coupling is modifyied according to the quark flavour.
      We add a factor 3, for SU(3), and a factor 3 (for ddbar) or 2 (for uubar)
      to take into account all the hadronic W decays
      (we don't do flavour tagging).

- on the accuracy of the boson decay: The NLO QCD correction to the W decay
  is given by alphas/pi * born. We include this factor in the event weight,
  by adding it to the virtual amplitude. Since the PS contains MEC for the
  boson decay, and NLO QCD correction in the decay of a white object are
  fully factorize from the one in production, this is equivalent to have a
  full NLO generator.
