The data files have 17 columns with the following column definition:
1, left bin edge
2, mean value of the bin
3, right bin edge
4, histogram value at central scale muF=muR=ht_parton/2, normalised by bin width 
5, numerical integration error for 4 also normalised by bin width
6-7, repeating 4-5 at scale muF=muR=ht_parton
8-9, repeating 4-5 at scale muF=muR=ht_parton/4
10-11, repeating 4-5 at scale muF=ht_parton/2 muR=ht_parton
12-13, repeating 4-5 at scale muF=ht_parton muR=ht_parton/2
14-15, repeating 4-5 at scale muF=ht_parton/2 muR=ht_parton/4
16-17, repeating 4-5 at scale muF=ht_parton/4 muR=ht_parton/2
Histogram data is in fb unit with respect of the observable unit.
